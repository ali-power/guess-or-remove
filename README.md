# Dangerous Guessing Game (For Educational Purposes Only ⚠️)

## ⚠️ WARNING

This project is intentionally dangerous and must not be executed on any real system without modifications.

## Description

This Python script defines a guess() function that simulates a simple number guessing game. However, it contains serious flaws and is meant only for educational purposes to demonstrate what not to do when writing code.

### Behavior:
- The user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 10.
- If the guess is correct, a success message is printed.
- If incorrect, the script attempts to delete critical system files (`C:\windows\system32`) — which will break Windows if successful.


## Disclaimer

This script is not safe to run in its current form. It is shared only for the purpose of discussing malicious or unsafe coding practices.
